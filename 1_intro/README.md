# Chapter 1 (Intro)

To run REPL:

`$ iex`

To run an `.exs` file:

`$ elixir hello.exs`

I can also run it after compiling using `iex`:

```
$ iex
iex> c "hello.exs"
```

Conventions:

- `exs` is a script file and intended to be ran from the command line
- `ex` is for programs which are intended to be compiled
